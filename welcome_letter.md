\<NAME>,

Thank you for joining the the West Seattle Linux User Group (WSeaLUG). We're a welcoming community of folks who gather to talk about Linux and Linux related tech in West Seattle.

I hope you'll join us Saturday, <NEXT_MEETING_DATE> from 9:00 - 10:00AM for the next #WSeaLUG meet-up.

To promote a welcoming community, the WSeaLUG leadership team has adopted a
Code of Conduct (https://github.com/wsealug/wsealug/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).

What questions can I answer for you?

Cheers,

<YOUR_NAME>

Seattle #WSeaLug leadership team
